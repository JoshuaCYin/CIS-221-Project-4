# Data Structures Project 4
Code Description: The code in MatrixBST.java implements a binary search tree using an array and adjacency matrix.
The code in MatrixBSTTestDriver.java tests the methods in MatrixBST.java.
The code in SearchBibleWord.java creates a binary tree of all the words in a user-selected book of the Bible along with the chapter/ verse references of where each word occurs in the book, and can use either the adjacency matrix implementation of MatrixBST.java or the linked structure binary search tree from the textbook found in BinarySearchTree.java.
Integrity Statement: I did not copy code from other people or sources other than our CIS-221 textbook. I did not use any AI software to help write code.
